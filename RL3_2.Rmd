## Agenda

* What is Machine Learning?
* Regression Analysis

## What is Machine Learning?

* How do you recognize a tree?

![Tree](images/tree.jpg)

* How do banks decide to approve or reject a credit card application?

![Credit Card](images/CreditCards.jpg)

## Types of Learning

* Binary Classification
    * Credit approve/disapprove
    * Email spam/non-spam
    * Patient sick/not sick
    * Ads profitable/not profitable
    * Answers correct/incorrect

## Recommended Studies

* [Andrew Ng, Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

* [林軒田，機器學習基石](https://www.youtube.com/user/hsuantien/playlists)

## Regression Analysis

## Fitting a linear regression

```{r}
install.packages("car")
library(car)
plot(Quartet$x, Quartet$y1)
lmFit <- lm(y1~x, Quartet)
abline(lmFit, col="red")
```

## Summarizing linear model fit

```{r}
summary(lmFit)
coefficients(lmFit) # Extract model coefficients
confint(lmFit, level=0.95) # Computes confidence intervals for model parameters.
fitted(lmFit) # Extract model fitted values
residuals(lmFit) # Extract model residuals
anova(lmFit) # Compute analysis of variance tables for fitted model object
vcov(lmFit) # Calculate variance-covariance matrix for a fitted model object
influence(lmFit) # Diagnose quality of regression fits
```

## Diagnostic Plots

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lmFit)
```

* Multiple variable linear regression

* Polynomial regression

* Robust linear regression

* Generalized linear regression

* Generalized additive
