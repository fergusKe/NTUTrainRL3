## Agenda

* What is Machine Learning?
* Regression Analysis

## What is Machine Learning?

* How do you recognize a tree?

* How do banks decide to approve or reject a credit card application?

## Regression Analysis

* Single variable linear regression

```{r}
install.packages("car")
library(car)
plot(Quartet$x, Quartet$y1)
lmFit <- lm(y1~x, Quartet)
summary(lmFit)
abline(lmFit, col="red")
coefficients(lmFit) # Extract model coefficients
confint(lmFit, level=0.95) # Computes confidence intervals for model parameters.
fitted(lmFit) # Extract model fitted values
residuals(lmFit) # Extract model residuals
anova(lmFit) # Compute analysis of variance tables for fitted model object
vcov(lmFit) # Calculate variance-covariance matrix for a fitted model object
influence(lmFit) # Diagnose quality of regression fits
```

* Multiple variable linear regression

* Polynomial regression

* Robust linear regression

* Generalized linear regression

* Generalized additive
